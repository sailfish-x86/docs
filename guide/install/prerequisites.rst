Preparing the device
--------------------

- It is recommended that a keyboard be attached if there is a detachable keyboard to type GRUB commands (first boot only)
- Secure Boot must be turned OFF in the BIOS. There are no plans to support Secure Boot at this time, as it requires signing which is paid.
