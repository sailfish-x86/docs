Known Limitations
=================

As with any port, there are some limitations that have not been solved. Only Maintainers should file these bugs in
the issue tracker.

- There is no Jolla Store access - some work is needed.
	- Most apps are available in OpenRepos. The default Jolla apps (notes, calendar, media player, calculator, etc) are available in the repository. 
- No palm rejection - needs some upstream work
- No OTA updates in the GUI
	- Updates are available in the command line with `ssu`
